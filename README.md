## Acknowledgement

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to [Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/@krishnaik06) for his end-to-end tutorials on GenAI. In my code, I used the 'gemini pro' model instead of the 'gemini-pro-vision' to read directly from uploaded PDF.

## Collaboration

Let me know if someone wants to build GenAI apps with me. Always open to cool projects and cool people!
